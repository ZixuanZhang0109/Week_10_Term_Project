# Commodity Trend ETF Strategy

## Overview
This repository contains the final term project for **MSDS 401**. The project develops and evaluates a **commodity trend-following strategy** using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and copper (COPX). The fund applies a dual moving average (20-day / 50-day) crossover strategy to capture medium-term price trends while managing risk.

The repository includes research reports, source code, simulation outputs, and figures, organized according to course requirements.

## Contents
### Reports
- **FinalTermProjectReport_ZixuanZhang.pdf**: Complete research paper (Week 10 submission).
- **Checkpoint Reports**: Iterative drafts (Checkpoints 1–3).

### Code
- **451Final.ipynb**: Contains implementation of:
  - Data acquisition (via `yfinance`)
  - Trading rule (20/50-day moving average crossover)
  - Backtesting (portfolio simulation)
  - Monte Carlo simulations
  - Performance evaluation and visualization
- **451Final.html**: Static export of the notebook.
- **requirements.txt**: Python libraries required to reproduce results.

### Data
- **commodity_etf_prices.csv**: Historical price data for GLD, SLV, and COPX (2010–2024).

### Figures
- Key plots generated by the notebook, including:
  - Strategy vs Buy-and-Hold equity curves
  - Drawdown charts
  - Monte Carlo simulated price paths
  - Distributions of simulated outcomes

## Reproducing Results
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r Code/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Code/451Final.ipynb
   ```

4. Outputs (tables, figures) will be generated in the `Figures/` directory.

## Performance Summary
- **Backtesting** shows that the trend-following strategy reduces drawdowns compared to buy-and-hold, especially in volatile assets like copper (COPX).
- **Monte Carlo simulations** (1000 paths) confirm that the strategy achieves outcomes above the median of simulated distributions, with strong downside protection.
- **Fee sensitivity** analysis highlights that performance declines under a “2 and 20” fee structure, underscoring the importance of scale and cost efficiency.

## GenAI Tools
This project made limited use of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for:
- Drafting portions of the written report (literature review summaries, section structuring).
- Generating boilerplate Python scripts and visualization templates.
- Refining explanations of investment philosophy and management recommendation.

Conversation logs are included separately as **GenAI_log.txt**.
